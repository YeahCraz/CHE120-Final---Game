Hi Franz and Winnie! The first you should do after opening the "main" file is press the run button (loop like a play button) 
<br>
**What is outlined Below is the installation of pygame in a venv!**

<br>
**1.** In your Python Terminal type 

> python -m venv venv

<br>

**2.** Next type  

> .\venv\Scripts\activate

<br>

**3.** Finally type  

> pip3 install pygame-ce

<br>

You are now able to use pygame, after this point you may type 

> pip install _______

for any desired module you would like to add to the project.
It may also ask you would like to update your "pip" copy and paste the code it spits out if you would like to.
<br>
To check if any module is up to date, type > pip install name of module --upgrade
